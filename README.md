# credentials-operator

Easily generate, store, and share credentials with applications running within a Kubernetes cluster.

In working on Kubernetes, I often find the process of generating credentials to be tedious.
Beyond generation, these credentials often need to be shared between systems.
For example, an application using MySQL needs to know the username and password it should use to connect.

## Status

Mostly a toy.
Wanted to play around with Ranchers' [Wrangler](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler) system and this seemed like a nifty idea.
If interest grows, I'm willing to support this a bit more.

## Getting Started

### Installing the Operator

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mjpitz/credentials-operator.git
helm upgrade -i credentials-operator ./charts/credentials-operator
```

### Creating a Credential

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: credentials.mjpitz.com/v1alpha1
kind: Credential
metadata:
  name: bitnami-mysql-passwords
spec:
  credentials:
    - key: DB_ROOT_PASSWORD
      requirements:
        length: 10
        characterSet: a-zA-Z0-9
    - key: DB_PASSWORD
      requirements:
        length: 10
        characterSet: a-zA-Z0-9
    - key: DB_REPLICATION_PASSWORD
      requirements:
        length: 10
        characterSet: a-zA-Z0-9
EOF
```

### Creating a Credential with views

Views are really useful when you need multiple representations of a set of credentials.
The credential below can be used in conjunction with [Bitnami's MySQL chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mysql).
It generates two different views for the same set of credentials.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: credentials.mjpitz.com/v1alpha1
kind: Credential
metadata:
  name: bitnami-mysql-passwords
spec:
  credentials:
    - key: DB_ROOT_PASSWORD
      requirements:
        length: 10
        characterSet: a-zA-Z0-9
    - key: DB_PASSWORD
      requirements:
        length: 10
        characterSet: a-zA-Z0-9
    - key: DB_REPLICATION_PASSWORD
      requirements:
        length: 10
        characterSet: a-zA-Z0-9
  views:
    - secretRef:
        name: bitnami-mysql-secret
      stringDataTemplate:
        mysql-root-password: ${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}
        mysql-password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
        mysql-replication-password: ${DB_REPLICATION_PASSWORD}
    - secretRef:
        name: myapp-db-config
      stringDataTemplate:
        DB_DRIVER: mysql
        DB_CONNECTION_STRING: myapp:${DB_PASSWORD}@tcp(mysql:3306)/dbname
EOF
```

The `bitnami-mysql-secret` is formatted according to the Helm chart's configuration.
The `myapp-db-config` shows how this same information can be represented differently.
The full set of secrets generated by this credential can be seen below. 

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: bitnami-mysql-passwords
stringData:
  DB_ROOT_PASSWORD: adminpass
  DB_PASSWORD: notsecure
  DB_REPLICATION_PASSWORD: replicationpass
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: bitnami-mysql-secret
stringData:
  mysql-root-password: adminpass
  mysql-password: notsecure
  mysql-replication-password: replicationpass
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: myapp-db-config
stringData:
  DB_DRIVER: mysql
  DB_CONNECTION_STRING: myapp:notsecure@tcp(mysql:3306)/dbname
```
